# Salary Prediction and Job Title Analysis: A Data-driven Approach


## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict salaries and analyze the relationship between job titles and compensation. It comprises data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and model evaluation steps.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, standardize education level values, and remove outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables, assign ranks to job titles, and create dummy variables.
3. **Modeling**: Fit Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Visualize the scatter plot comparing actual and predicted salaries to assess model performance.
